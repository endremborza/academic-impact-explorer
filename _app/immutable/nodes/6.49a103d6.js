			the academic landscape. To calculate RCA, we begin by selecting a meaningful reference group from
			dataset. This reference group provides a baseline against which we evaluate the specialization
			of the entity in question. The RCA score is computed by comparing the proportion of an entity&#39;s
			impact in a specific field to the proportion of impact in the same field for the chosen reference
			group. Mathematically, RCA is expressed as: RCA = (Proportion of Entity&#39;s Impact in Field) / (Proportion
			of Reference Group&#39;s Impact in Field)</p> <p class="svelte-aob211">It&#39;s important to note that the choice of impact definition and reference group can vary
			depending on the specific analysis goals and context. In some cases, we might measure impact
			in terms of the number of papers published, whereas in others, we may use the number of
			citations received. Additionally, the reference group itself can be tailored to the specific
			question at hand. For example, when assessing the impact of a research entity within a on a
			specific university, the reference group may consist exclusively of entities from that same
			country, providing a localized context for the analysis.</p>`,t,l,f,I="We utilize predefined classification, and calculate simple metrics.",b,d,C,k,E=L(o[0]),w=[];for(let h=0;h<E.length;h+=1)w[h]=q(j(o,E,h));return C=new de({props:{data:ue}}),{c(){e=M("div"),e.innerHTML=s,g=O(),m=M("div");for(let h=0;h<w.length;h+=1)w[h].c();a=O(),r=M("div"),i=M("div"),i.innerHTML=n,t=O(),l=M("div"),f=M("h1"),f.textContent=I,b=O(),d=M("div"),Y(C.$$.fragment),this.h()},l(h){e=P(h,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),z(e)!=="svelte-1kyk95b"&&(e.innerHTML=s),g=T(h),m=P(h,"DIV",{class:!0});var y=A(m);for(let x=0;x<w.length;x+=1)w[x].l(y);y.forEach(u),a=T(h),r=P(h,"DIV",{class:!0});var c=A(r);i=P(c,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),z(i)!=="svelte-374lv6"&&(i.innerHTML=n),t=T(c),l=P(c,"DIV",{class:!0});var _=A(l);f=P(_,"H1",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),z(f)!=="svelte-17mnle0"&&(f.textContent=I),b=T(_),d=P(_,"DIV",{class:!0});var B=A(d);ee(C.$$.fragment,B),B.forEach(u),_.forEach(u),c.forEach(u),this.h()},h(){p(e,"class","bstrip"),p(m,"class","bstrip"),p(i,"class","bar svelte-aob211"),p(f,"class","svelte-aob211"),p(d,"class","tile-container svelte-aob211"),p(l,"class","bar svelte-aob211"),p(r,"class","bstrip")},m(h,y){S(h,e,y),S(h,g,y),S(h,m,y);for(let c=0;c<w.length;c+=1)w[c]&&w[c].m(m,null);S(h,a,y),S(h,r,y),v(r,i),v(r,t),v(r,l),v(l,f),v(l,b),v(l,d),ie(C,d,null),k=!0},p(h,[y]){if(y&1){E=L(h[0]);let c;for(c=0;c<E.length;c+=1){const _=j(h,E,c);w[c]?w[c].p(_,y):(w[c]=q(_),w[c].c(),w[c].m(m,null))}for(;c<w.length;c+=1)w[c].d(1);w.length=E.length}},i(h){k||($(C.$$.fragment,h),k=!0)},o(h){F(C.$$.fragment,h),k=!1},d(h){h&&(u(e),u(g),u(m),u(a),u(r)),U(w,h),te(C)}}}function ve(o){return[[{desc:"Works",num:D.counts.work,color:15},{desc:"Institutions",num:D.counts.inst,color:25},{desc:"Citations",num:D.counts.cite,color:50},{desc:"Countries",num:D.counts.country,color:90}]]}class Ee extends J{constructor(e){super(),X(this,e,ve,fe,Q,{})}}export{Ee as component};
